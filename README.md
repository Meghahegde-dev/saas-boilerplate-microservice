## **Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**

Node.js v18+

Docker & Docker Compose

MongoDB (or use Docker setup)

**Run Locally with Docker**
# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

**Run Services Individually**
# Navigate to a service folder, e.g., auth-service
cd auth-service
npm install
npm run dev

**Adding a New Service**

Create a new folder for your service.

Initialize Node.js and install dependencies.

Add routes, controllers, and models.

Register the service in docker-compose.yml and the API Gateway.

Use shared libraries/helpers as needed.

## **📄 Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in each service with variables like:

PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

## **Docker Support**

docker-compose up — start all services

docker-compose down — stop all services

Services will run in separate containers, communicating via the gateway
